    <h1>The Time I got my First Job</h1>
    <main>
  <p>I can certainly say that the best time of my life was when I got my first job in Cognizant. I was selected among thousands of other candidates</p>
  <p>I was very excited to travel to the location of job and learn alot of new things in the professional enviroment.</p>  
  <p>I got the oppurtunity to work with one of the best minds in the world and it was such a great experience . It helped my career to grow</p>
  <p>I really miss working there and would be eager to go back again if I get the oppurtunity </p>
